**Namaste JavaScript**

**EP-01**

1. Everything in JavaScript happen inside an **execution context**.
2. Execution context has 2 components.
3. One is a memory component called variable environment which stores variables, functions in key value form.
4. Second is a code component called **Thread of execution** which runs line by line.
5. JavaScript is a synchronous single threaded langauge. That means it runs one line by line, it means after finishing one line it goes to the other.
