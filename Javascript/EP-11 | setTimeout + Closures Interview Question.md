This question will strengthen your knowledge and understanding of Closures and will also help you in your frontend/full stack/ web development interview. We will start with an easy JS question and slowly move to the hard and tricky interview question.

If you are giving web developer interviews actively, there are high chances that you might find this question in your frotend developer interview. Candidates have faced this question in their interviews for Amazon, Facebook, Paypal, Microsoft and many other big tech firms.

SetTimeout doesn't stop the next line of code execution.

if 3000 ms wait. The line inside the setTimeout will wait for 3000 ms. But other lines next to setTimeout continues to execute without stopping.

function x()
var i = 1;
setTimeout (function () t console. log (i);
}, 3000);
console. log ("Namaste JavaScript");
x()

output namaste javascript 1

settime out function will be stored in closure with reference of i and so it will be called after time out expires

function x()
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
setTimeout (function () {
console. log(i);
1,1* 1000）
console. log ("Namaste JavaScript");
x();

for this code the output is Namaste JavaScript 6 6 6 6 6

the output is 6 because of closure

but if you use let instead of var. you will get correct output and because let have block scope and it will store i value for each iterationfunction x() {
for (var i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
function close (x) {
setTimeout (function () {
console. log (x);
x * 1000);
｝
close (i);
console. log ("Namaste JavaScript");
x();

# Understanding Closures and `setTimeout` in JavaScript

In JavaScript, closures and the behavior of `setTimeout` often appear in interviews because they reveal a candidate's understanding of scopes and asynchronous execution. Let’s explore this with examples and explanations.

---

## Key Concepts

1. **Closures**:
   A closure is created when a function "remembers" the variables from its lexical scope even after the outer function has completed execution.

2. **`setTimeout`**:
   - `setTimeout` schedules a task to run after a specified delay without blocking the main thread.
   - JavaScript continues executing subsequent lines of code without waiting for the timer.

## Example 1: Understanding `setTimeout` and `var`

```
function x() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}
x();
```
