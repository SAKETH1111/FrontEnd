    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
     <!-- This link has the code of react dom to modify or change the Dom -->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <!-- Moved the code to App.js -->
    <script src ="./App.js">
        //  // It will take 3 arguments, first tag type, second one will give attributes to the tag,third we need to put the content we need in the first tag
        //  const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello World from React!!");
        // // If we need to put h1 tag into the root. We need to use the ReactDom to do that because ReactDOM manages the root.
        // const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        // // rendering the react root
        // root.render(heading);

<!-- // What is CDN?
// What is crossorigin?

Code is running in Sequence.

// React is plain Javascript code. React is a JavaScript Library
// You can see that code in CDN Links from above Links. 
You can open console log and press React and ReactDom to see all the details regarding the react library and features

// React can only be used in small part of webpage. It can work independently.
Thats why React is a library not a framework.
// Whereas Framework comes with lot of information , 
bundles Like we need to create whole framework to create an app. 
But library can be used in any part of framework or app independently of the framework.
