1. Everything in React can be done by using HTML and CSS, Why are we using react then???
2. React gives your coding experience fast and gives you super power to do more with less efforts.
3. Best practice is to seperate component in seperate files. You can create seperate folder called components and move the code over there.
5. src is the main folder in the project of any application.
6. You can use .js, .jsx , .ts , .tsx as extension of the file
7. Keep the file name first letter as it is capital letter.
8. before we import a component, we need to export the componenet.
9. extension is not mandatory in `import paths` is not required.
10. Never keep hard coded data in Components. You can create a folder called `utils` or `common`, `constants`.
11. All constants should be in CAPITAL_LETTERS
